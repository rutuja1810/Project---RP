    Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support 
    for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal
    origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, 
    fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested 
    by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
    energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of
    animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs.

    hotel room for consumption. Room service is organised as a 
    subdivision within the food and beverage department of high-end
    hotel and resort properties. It is uncommon for room service to 
    be offered in hotels that are not high-end, or in motels. Room 
    service may also be provided for guests on cruise ships.Room
