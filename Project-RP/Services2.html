    A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a North American term for a large indoor
    shopping center, usually anchored by department stores. The term "mall" originally
    meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it (that is, the term was used to 
    refer to the walkway itself which was merely bordered by such shops), but in the 
    late 1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping
    centers that were becoming commonplace at the time.

    Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or 
    services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to 
    purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been 
    developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational 
    shoppers,that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.
    Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers.
