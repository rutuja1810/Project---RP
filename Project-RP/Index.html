            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>
                Transport (in British English), or transportation (in American English),
                is the movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to another.
                In other words,the action of transport is defined as a particular 
                movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a point B.Modes 
                of transport include air, land water, cable, pipeline, and space. 
                The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.
                Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the
                development of civilizations.Transport infrastructure consists of
                the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways.

            <h2>Restaurants</h2>
            <p>
                A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food
                and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and 
                eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out
                and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance
                and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service
                models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias
                to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.  
                The earliest modern-format "restaurants" to use that word in Paris 
                were the establishments which served bouillon, a broth made of meat
                and egg which was said to restore health and vigour.

            <h2>Shopping Centers</h2>
            <p>
                A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a North American term for a 
                large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department stores.
                The term "mall" originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops 
                along it (that is, the term was used to refer to the walkway itself
                which was merely bordered by such shops), but in the late 1960s, it
                began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping 
                centers that were becoming commonplace at the time. In the U.K.,
                such complexes are considered shopping centres though "shopping
                center" covers many more sizes and types of centers than the
                North American "mall".
